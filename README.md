# CoreEngine

This is my playground / test site for a game engine thingy. Trying to make it a slim, easy to use foundation for 2d games.

As of now, the most notable feature is the ability to keep the game running, even while the window is being resized/moved.
This is also a prime example of me getting lost in small details, so don't expect this project to be useful any time soon.
